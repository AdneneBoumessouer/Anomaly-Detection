TO DO:
Retrieve requirements.txt file of Amazon's tensorflow2_p36's conda env (or local environment if it works)
Refactor main so that it is possible to pass a model_path as argument to start a new round of training.


Observations:
Old model seems to work better...possible causes: change in architecture (MaxPool2D) and loss function (1 - MSSIM)
